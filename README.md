# Python-Challenge
This project showcases the basic elements of Python. The scripts are simple but demonstrate skills required for basic analysis of  
a CSV in Python. There are two sections, each representing a real work analysis situation. Each section includes a dataset, a Python  
script, and a text file with the results. 

## PyBank
This dataset includes several years of revenue information for a bank. The main.py script extracts the following from the dataset:  
* The total number of months included in the dataset  
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes  
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll
This dataset is the voting information for a small, rural town. It is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.  
The main.py script extracts the following: 
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on the popular vote
