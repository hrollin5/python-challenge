# Python-Challenge
This project showcases the basic elements of Python. The scripts are simple but demonstrate skills required for the analysis of a CSV file in core Python. There are two sections, each representing a real work analysis situation. Each section includes a dataset, a Python script, and a text file with the results. 

## PyBank
This dataset includes several years of revenue information for a bank. The main.py script extracts the following from the dataset:  
* The total number of months included in the dataset  
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes  
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll
This dataset is the voting information for a small, rural town. It is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.  
The main.py script extracts the following: 
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on the popular vote


## Feedback on Assignment
"Hi Haley, Congratulations on an amazing assignment submission! You truly showcased your abilities to work with python. You were able to read in both CSVs for PyBank and PyPoll and the header rows were successfully stored. The results for both were then correctly printed to the terminal. You found the total months, average change, and greatest increase/decrease for PyBank and the total votes for each candidate for PyPoll. Your code also runs error free and is very clean. There are also comments throughout to explain the process and what each line of code does. The results for each were also exported into a text file. This was an amazing assignment Haley. You should be very proud of all your hard work. Keep it up!
